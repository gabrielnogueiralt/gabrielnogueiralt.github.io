Hello!
======
I'm a software engineer and researcher currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of Pernambuco. My journey through software development has taken me from building scalable web applications to deep dives into large language models, machine learning, blockchain technologies and formal methods. I have been fortunate to apply my skills in both academic and professional environments, most recently as an Academic Visitor at the University of Oxford, where I focus on enhancing the reliability of blockchain applications through formal methods and machine learning.

Professionally, I've worked on diverse projects that span full-stack development, utilizing frameworks such as Vue, React (Next) on the frontend, and Python with Fastapi, NodeJS and Docker on the backend. In addition, my expertise extends to DevOps practices and cloud technologies, particularly AWS, enabling me to contribute across the entire technology stack.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing the guitar, reading, and spending quality time with my family and friends. Iâ€™m driven by a passion for continuous learning, which fuels my enthusiasm for tackling emerging technologies and complex systems.
